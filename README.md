# Introduction

For years I've been told that doing technical deep dives in a podcast format just wouldn't work. Well, I'm a big fan of not accepting "It just won't work" at face value - so let's try it, shall we? :)

This repository will eventually likely hold show notes and the like, but for now it's just a place for people to
submit episode ideas. My plan is to interview the key developers for a given open source project and really dig
into the nitty gritty. What architectural choices were made when this was designed? What language did you choose
and why? What are some interesting corners of the code that might teach others new ways of thinking about a given
problem or lend themselves to re-use?

I work a very full time job so initially at least I'll commit to doing 1 episode each month. Producing a podcast
takes time, and my dream job working at Amazon makes some sincere demands on mine.

A note to my former [Podcast.__init__](https://pythonpodcast.com/) listeners: Hi! I can't tell you how much I appreciated all the great
feedback I got from you in my time with the podcast. I hope you'll join me on this new journey even though
we'll be talking about projects written in other programming languages. Python is still my language of choice
and its community will always have a special place in my heart, but we've already got two Python podcasts and
don't need a third :) Besides, I want to be able to sate my curiosity (and hopefully yours!) without restriction!

# Ideas for episodes

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* [Boto](https://github.com/boto/boto3) I dunno if I can swing this. Will need to likely seek internal approvals.
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [TIC-80](https://tic.computer/)
* [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)
* [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
